    "In this lab I will be analyzing data for Snowy Owls, Lazuli Buntings, Harlequin Ducks, Bramblings, Black Swifts, and Anna's Hummingbirds. We were given an overwhelming amount of data from ebird and we were supposed to figure out what to do with it, how to use it, and how to answer specific questions with it. We were given the task of thinning out the data do use what we needed in order to give a clear and concise argument, using evidence, to answer a question or questions. In this case, I decided to describe the patterns of occurrence in King County for each species, by month. I did so by looking at the amount of observations for each bird along with the amount of sightings per observations. I go into further detail in the following analyses."

    "    With this code we were able to analyze the patterns of appearance of 6 different birds, by month, in the King County. In order to achieve this task, I had to sift through a lot of unnecessary data from ebird. There was a lot of interesting data in the csv files including specific location of the observations of the different birds, longitude and latitude of the bird sightings, the list goes on. However, the data that was necessary for this part of the lab was the specific date of the observations. Specifically, I needed to know when the observations occurred so I could arrange the observations by month. I programmed the code to go through all of the observation dates and pinpoint what month the observations took place on (I had it check the first part of the date i.e. \"11/...\" would be November). If the code saw the date 11/12/15, it would see that the observation took place in November and it would add 1 to the \"November\" variable. This was done for every bird, for every month of the year. Then all the data was printed in a readable format.\n",
    "    We learned a few things from the data. First of all, some birds did not appear at all in certain months. For example, the Snowy Owl only appeared in November, December, January, February, and March; the Bramblings only appeared in February, March, and April; and the Black Swift only appeared in May, June, April, August, and September. However, the Harlequin Ducks and Anna's Hummingbirds appeared every day of the month. These patterns have some implication. From these patterns we can assume a few things for each of these birds: seasonal preference, temperature preference, density of the population, and maybe even migration patterns (more data in different counties/ states would help). For instance, the Snowy Owls only show up during the Winter season, implying they prefer the cold weather; the Lazuli Bunting on the other hand appeared only in the Summer season. This pattern of appearance carries over to the Black Swift a little. The Black Swifts appear during late summer and stop appearing in the early winter. As for the Bramblings, they only appear 3 months of the year (February, March, and April). This could mean a few things: The Bramblings pass through the King County during this time of year, something disrupted their migration/general path and pushed them off-course into the King county, there are a lot of possibilities. Lastly, Anna's Hummingbirds seem to be very common relative to the other birds. There are thousands of sightings every month with no exception, implying that they are a plentiful species in the area. However, the numbers do seem disproportionate.\n",
    "    There are a few things that must be taken into account when approaching this data. Since this is an open source data center, the data is not completely consistent. For instance, there is a possibility that more people observe Anna's Hummingbird over other species. In this case, it is quite evident that there is far more data on Anna's Hummingbird than the other birds. This causes the data to look like Anna's Hummingbird is FAR more prevalent than other species, while this might not be true. There is also a possibility that people's observations overlap. Two people might see the same bird."

    "In part 2 of this analysis we are able to clarify some of the confusions we had with the initial data. First off, the data set I used was different from the first. I used the number of birds seen in each individual observation. This will give me a more exact idea of how common these birds are versus the amount of people that have seen them. This is because I am looking at how many birds each person saw versus how many people have seen the bird. After I put the numbers of birds seen per observation session into arrays for each bird, I found the mean of each array. Then I appended those means into one final array so that I could graph it into a histogram. However, it is important to note that there are outliers. On average, there are about 6 Black Swift birds seen per observation, and about 5 Harlequin Ducks per observation session. The other birds seem to be close to 1-2 birds seen per observation. After looking at the histogram I realized a few more things. For one, Anna's Hummingbird is not one of the outliers. Therefore, my confusion about the number for the Anna's Hummingbird was justified. This clearly tells us that there is MUCH more data for Anna's Hummingbird than any of the other birds because for every observation session, there are only around 2 birds seen. While it still seems to be more common than most of the other birds, it is not quite as common as the FIRST analysis made it seem. Also, one thing that stands out to me is the fact that there are so many sightings per observation session for the Black Swifts. This confusion arose because this bird only appears for a part of the year. However, when the birds are appearing, the appearances seem to be quite common. Lastly, I think it is very important to note the statistics we have on the Bramblings. The mean of sightings per session for this bird is 1. Since this birds appearances are so stark I would conclude that we don't get very much from the data, because we don't have enough. All we know is that they are uncommon, and they show up for a few months of the year."

    "One thing that has become more significant over the course of this lab is that data must be interpreted in several different ways/ from different angles. Trying one method to analyze data can be very misleading. Finding multiple angles and comparing those angles is a necessity. After looking at the number of observations for each bird, we found out the variable commonality of the different birds, to an extent. However, we did have a baseline of knowledge to work off of. We built on that knowledge by looking at the amount of birds seen per observation. This showed us how skewed the data was in terms of quantity. The Anna’s Hummingbirds turned out to be less common than we thought they were initially. However, it did also confirm the validity of the data on the Harlequin Duck. Specifically, it showed us that the Harlequin duck is consistently fairly common. However, to speak to that point (as mentioned in the explanation for the lab), the Harlequin Duck may be sought after by birders, encouraging birders to try hard to find them, and to find more than just one. This is a very real possibility. However, this really speaks to my point. In order to interpret such vast and different sets of data all at once, the data MUST be approached from many different directions."
